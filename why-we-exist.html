    <h1>Why We Exist</h1>
    <h2>Disability Gaps in Africa and Kenya</h2>
    <p>
      The statistics below expose the urgent gaps in disability inclusion across Africa and Kenya, revealing why Africa Ability Trust is committed to changing this reality. These statistics aren’t just numbers, they represent real people, names, dreams and stories of real people longing to belong.
    </p>

    <h3>Disability Prevalence</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Over 80 million Africans (up to 15% of the population) live with disabilities. Governments report under 5%, due to stigma and outdated definitions.</li>
      <li>Kenya 2019 Census: 2.2% (918,000 people) identified as living with disabilities. Broader studies estimate it could be 12% or more, especially including hidden or mild disabilities and accounting for underreporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Employment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only 20–30% of working-age persons with disabilities in Africa are employed, leaving an estimated 70–80% without work.</li>
      <li>In Kenya, it is estimated that fewer than 10% of employers offer disability-friendly infrastructure, policies, or recruitment practices, leaving the majority of PWDs excluded from meaningful employment environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Faith-Based Inclusion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Less than 1% of churches across Africa have formal disability inclusion programs yet roughly 49% of Africans identify as Christian.</li>
      <li>Approximately 1 - 3% of parachurch organizations serve primarily in disability ministry. Most prioritize youth, widows, or economic needs, leaving disability ministry largely underserved both in Kenya and across Africa.</li>
      <li>In Kenya, fewer than 2–3% of churches have a formal disability ministry and 80–85% of churches lack any intentional disability inclusion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Africa, only 20–30% of children with disabilities attend school.</li>
      <li>In Kenya, the situation is even more severe, with just around 6% enrolled and those who do enroll are 60% more likely to drop out than their non-disabled peers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Therapy and Accessibility Tools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Across Africa, an estimated 5–15% of persons with disabilities have access to assistive devices or therapy.</li>
      <li>In Kenya, the figure is slightly higher at 17–32%, yet the majority still remain without the support they need.</li>
    </ul>
