    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <h2>It Started with a Calling</h2>
    <p>
      In 2012, Beryl, one of our co-founders, in her hometown in Nyamira County, started to pursue a lifelong calling: walking alongside persons with disabilities (PWDs) and their caregivers. She began with grassroots awareness campaigns in Kitutu Masaba, visiting churches and homes to build authentic, faith-rooted connections.
    </p>

    <h2>A Community Begins to Rise</h2>
    <p>
      Her early work led to the creation of the GIKEBO Disabled Self-Help Group, bringing together families from Gachuba, Kebirichi, and Bonyunyu villages. Today, the group includes 43 families who gather regularly for emotional support, spiritual growth, and economic empowerment through community-led initiatives like table banking.
    </p>

    <h2>A Partnership with Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Beryl enrolled at Moi University to study Special Needs Education. There, she met Gideon, and inspired him to join the movement for disability inclusion. Together, they expanded their mission beyond the Kisii region. Their personal lives reflected this mission as they became foster parents to children with disabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>New Ground, Same Heart</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2014, Gideon served with a Christian parachurch organization and engaged in several community development projects. During this time, he observed the critical gap in disability inclusion within community organizations, churches, and broader community structures. This fueled his long-term commitment to advocate for persons with disabilities (PWDs). His service led him to Kibera, one of Africa’s largest informal settlements, where he began working with vulnerable youth. Beryl soon joined him, bringing her special education expertise.
    </p>

    <h2>Seeing the Gap. Creating Change.</h2>
    <p>
      In Kibera, they discovered a major gap: churches and parachurch organizations were not actively serving PWDs. Motivated to respond, they launched formal programs focused on the needs of PWDs and their families.
    </p>

    <h2>A Center of Belonging</h2>
    <p>
      This shared vision gave birth to Africa Ability Trust’s community center in Kibera, a place of hope, healing, and belonging. We strive to offer families access to therapy, inclusive technology, faith-based support, and the steadfast assurance that every ability is seen, celebrated, and supported.
