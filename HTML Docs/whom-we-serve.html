    <h1>Whom Do We Serve?</h1>
    <p>
      At Africa Ability Trust, our calling is rooted in relationship. We serve not just individuals, but entire support network, families, communities, and faith institutions, so that every person with a disability can flourish in a world that welcomes them fully. Our work embraces the following groups:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Persons with disabilities (PWDs)</strong><br />
        We walk alongside children, youth, and adults with disabilities at every stage of life, ensuring they are seen, supported, and empowered in ways that uphold their dignity and potential.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Caregivers</strong><br />
        These are parents, siblings, and guardians navigating the journey of care. We uplift those who provide daily emotional, physical, and spiritual support to PWDs, recognizing their resilience and equipping them with tools, encouragement, and community.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Organizations and companies</strong><br />
        We partner with institutions seeking to create workplaces, programs, and services that welcome and accommodate persons with disabilities.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Community members</strong><br />
        These include educators, health workers, and neighbors. We engage local stakeholders who shape everyday experiences, equipping them to build more inclusive schools, clinics, and neighborhoods where every person feels they belong.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Churches and parachurch organizations</strong><br />
        We train and equip faith communities to embrace persons with disabilities as full participants in spiritual life, transforming churches into spaces of belonging and mutual discipleship.
      </li>
    </ul>
